It is strongly typed and OOP language.

#### Components of Typescript



* **Language** − It comprises of the syntax, keywords, and type annotations.
* **The TypeScript Compiler** − The TypeScript compiler \(tsc\) converts the instructions written in TypeScript to its JavaScript equivalent.
* **The TypeScript Language Service** − The "Language Service" exposes an additional layer around the core compiler pipeline that are editor-like applications. The language service supports the common set of a typical editor operations like statement completions, signature help, code formatting and outlining, colorization, etc.

#### Declaration Files

 When a TypeScript script gets compiled, there is an option to generate a **declaration file** \(with the extension **.d.ts**\) that functions as an interface to the components in the compiled JavaScript. The concept of declaration files is analogous to the concept of header files found in C/C++. The declaration files \(files with **.d.ts** extension\) provide intellisense for types, function calls, and variable support for JavaScript libraries like jQuery, MooTools, etc.

#### Use of TSC Complier

The TSC produces an equivalent JavaScript source code from the Typescript file given as an input to it. This process is termed as transpilation.

#### Why do we need Node.js?

Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for server-side JavaScript. Node.js is required to run JavaScript without a browser support.



####  A TypeScript program is composed of −

* Modules
* Functions
* Variables
* Statements and Expressions
* Comments
